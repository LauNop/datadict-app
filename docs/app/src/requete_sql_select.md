## File path

.\app\src\requete_sql_select.py

## Purpose of file

This file is responsible for defining a class `RequeteSQLSelect` that extends the `FileSelection` class. It overrides some methods from the parent class and adds a new method `generate_data_dict`.

## Codebase

### Imports:

1. `from .file_selection import FileSelection`

    This import is used to import the `FileSelection` class from the `file_selection` module in the current package. The `FileSelection` class is used as the parent class for the `RequeteSQLSelect` class.

2. `from datadict_toolbox import SelectGPTDeduce`

    This import is used to import the `SelectGPTDeduce` class from the `datadict_toolbox` module. The `SelectGPTDeduce` class is used to perform some data dictionary generation tasks in the `generate_data_dict` method of the `RequeteSQLSelect` class.

### Classes

#### Class: RequeteSQLSelect

Purpose: This class extends the `FileSelection` class and adds some additional functionality specific to generating SQL select data dictionaries.

##### Methods:

1. `__init__(self, master=None)`

    This method is the constructor of the `RequeteSQLSelect` class. It calls the constructor of the parent class `FileSelection` with the `master` parameter and sets the `button_label` attribute to "Generate SQL Select Data Dict".

    ##### Variables:
    - `self.master`: This variable stores the master widget.
    - `self.button_label`: This variable stores the label for the button.

2. `browse_file_or_folder(self)`

    This method overrides the `browse_file_or_folder` method of the parent class. It calls the `browse_file_or_folder` method of the parent class and returns.

3. `browse_save_dir(self)`

    This method overrides the `browse_save_dir` method of the parent class. It calls the `browse_save_dir` method of the parent class and returns.

4. `get_files(self, file_type)`

    This method overrides the `get_files` method of the parent class. It calls the `get_files` method of the parent class with the `file_type` parameter and returns the result.

5. `reset_file_path(self)`

    This method overrides the `reset_file_path` method of the parent class. It calls the `reset_file_path` method of the parent class and returns.

6. `show_warning_popup(self)`

    This method overrides the `show_warning_popup` method of the parent class. It calls the `show_warning_popup` method of the parent class and returns.

7. `generate_data_dict(self)`

    This method generates a data dictionary by calling the `generate_data_dict` method of the parent class. If the data dictionary generation is successful, it prints "Processing". It also creates an instance of the `SelectGPTDeduce` class from the `datadict_toolbox` module.

### Variables:

There are no global variables defined in this file.
